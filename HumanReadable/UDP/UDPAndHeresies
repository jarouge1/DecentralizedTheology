# Structural Heresies in Christology and Beyond

## Using Scripture as a Test Case

This document uses the doctrine of Scripture as a diagnostic test case. The goal is to demonstrate that structural heresies originally found in Christology, especially those mapped by the Council of Chalcedon, reappear in other doctrines that involve a union of divine and created elements. Scripture is not the only doctrine affected by these patterns. Baptism, the Gospel Call, and other bridge doctrines may show similar distortions. But Scripture is used here because it provides a clear, accessible example of how these structural errors work in practice. Once these patterns are seen in Scripture, they can be identified elsewhere as well.

## Chalcedonian Structure as a Diagnostic Grid

The Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) did not merely protect the doctrine of Christ. It gave us a map for avoiding theological errors across multiple doctrines. According to Chalcedon, Christ is one person in two natures, fully divine and fully human, without confusion, change, division, or separation.

These four boundaries do more than describe Christ. They expose the structure of every major Christological heresy. And because the same kinds of divine-human union appear in other doctrines, like Scripture, Baptism, and the Gospel Call, these structural errors also reappear outside of Christology. The Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP) applies Chalcedonian logic to these doctrines, showing how the same four boundary-breaking errors — confusion, change, division, and separation — threaten union in different ways.

Many heresies exist, but they are not endlessly creative. Each one breaks the Chalcedonian structure in a limited number of ways. By identifying how the break occurs, we can expose heresy even when it appears under a new name or in a different doctrine.
