# Structural Heresies in Christology and Beyond  
## Using Scripture as a Test Case

This document uses the doctrine of Scripture to demonstrate a deeper claim: the same structural errors that once distorted our understanding of Christ have reappeared in other doctrines. These errors are not just historical relics. They are recurring patterns.

Specifically, we are focusing on doctrines that involve a real union between something divine and something created. In these “bridge doctrines,” God does not merely act on creation from a distance. He joins it in some way that demands careful theological grammar. Scripture is one of the clearest examples, and that is why we start here.

## Chalcedon as a Theological Grid

The Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) was called to protect the truth about Christ: that He is one person in two natures, fully divine and fully human. It gave us four boundaries to guard this union:

- Without **confusion**  
- Without **change**  
- Without **division**  
- Without **separation**

These are not just historical guardrails for Christology. They form a logical structure that protects any doctrine where God unites with creation. The Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP) applies this Chalcedonian logic to other doctrines. And when we apply it to Scripture, something becomes very clear:

The same structural errors that attacked Christ are attacking the Bible.

## The Four Structural Errors in Scripture

### 1. Confusion: Blurring God’s words with human opinion

In this view, Scripture is treated as a mixture of divine truth and human ideas. It becomes unclear what part is from God and what part is from man. Inspiration is vague or mystical. The Bible “contains” God’s word but is not always **the** word of God.

This echoes **Eutychianism** and **Monophysitism**, which fused Christ’s natures into one blended form. When applied to Scripture, the human authorship is blurred into something mysterious, or the divine truth is diluted.

---

### 2. Change: God’s message altered to fit human limits

Here, the divine message is thought to lose something in translation. People claim God had to “accommodate” Himself to ancient culture or flawed language, and the result is an inspired but error-filled Bible.

This mirrors **Apollinarianism**, **Monothelitism**, and **Kenoticism** — heresies where either the divine or human nature of Christ is diminished or changed in the union. In Scripture, this error suggests the union with human language degrades divine truth.

---

### 3. Division: Separating parts of Scripture as more or less divine

In this case, the Bible is divided into higher and lower levels of authority. The words of Jesus may be treated as fully divine, but the rest as merely human. Some books are seen as more inspired than others. Some passages are dismissed as outdated or inferior.

This reflects **Nestorianism** and **Arianism**, which divided Christ into two agents or ranked His divinity. When this division is applied to Scripture, the result is fragmentation and selective authority.

---

### 4. Separation: Denying any real union between God and the text

This view sees the Bible as purely human. It may be spiritually meaningful, but it is not divinely authored. At best, Scripture is a record of people’s experiences with God. At worst, it is just religious literature like any other.

This echoes **Psilanthropism**, **Docetism**, and **Adoptionism** — heresies that deny the full union of God and man in Christ. Applied to Scripture, this error treats divine authorship as symbolic, not real.

## Summary Table

| Structural Error | Christological Heresies                    | Scripture Error Example                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Confusion        | Eutychianism, Monophysitism                 | God's word blurred with human ideas                |
| Change           | Apollinarianism, Monothelitism, Kenoticism | God's word changed to fit human limits             |
| Division         | Nestorianism, Arianism                      | Some parts divine, others human                    |
| Separation       | Psilanthropism, Docetism, Adoptionism       | No real union — just a human book                  |

## Why This Matters

The same four structural errors keep returning because they are not random. They are what happens when we try to simplify divine-human union by removing the mystery or tilting the balance too far in one direction.

This pattern matters because the Bible is not just a book. It is the place where God joins His voice to human language. And just as Christ’s union must be guarded, so must this one. If we lose the structure of that union, we lose the authority, unity, and reliability of Scripture itself.

The Unified Distinction Pattern is not about controlling how people talk about theology. It is about protecting the way God has chosen to reveal Himself. These patterns help us see more clearly, guard more faithfully, and reject errors before they destroy the coherence of doctrine.

Chalcedon was not just about Christ. It was about how God works in the world.
