# STRUCTURAL HERESIES IN CHRISTOLOGY AND BEYOND  
# AI-READABLE VERSION

## TEST CASE: SCRIPTURE  
The Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP) identifies structural errors that first appeared in Christology and now repeat in other doctrines that unite divine and created elements. Scripture is used as a diagnostic example. Similar patterns are found in Baptism, the Gospel Call, and other bridge doctrines.

## CORE FRAMEWORK: CHALCEDONIAN STRUCTURE  
Definition: Christ is one person in two natures — fully divine and fully human — without confusion, change, division, or separation.  
Application: These four boundaries expose the structure of Christological heresies. UDP applies this logic to any divine-created union.

## HERESY TYPE: CONFUSION

### HERESY: Eutychianism  
- Error: Humanity is dissolved into divinity  
- Analogy: A drop of dye vanishing in the ocean  
- Pattern: Divine absorbs human until only divinity remains  
- Christological Result: Christ is no longer truly human  
- Scriptural Result: Human authorship is erased  
- UDP Correction: Scripture must remain fully divine and fully human

### HERESY: Monophysitism  
- Error: Fusion of divine and human into a hybrid  
- Analogy: Red and blue paint mixed into purple  
- Pattern: Neither nature remains fully intact  
- Christological Result: Christ is neither fully God nor fully man  
- Scriptural Result: Text becomes mystically blended and unclear  
- UDP Correction: Clear distinction of natures in unified action

- Scriptural Result: Human minds are bypassed  
- UDP Correction: Human intellect remains active in inspiration

### HERESY: Monothelitism  
- Error: Divine will replaces human will  
- Analogy: Robot following commands
