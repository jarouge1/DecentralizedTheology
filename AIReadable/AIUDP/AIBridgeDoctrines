# DEFINITION: Bridge Doctrine

A **bridge doctrine** is a theological doctrine in which God unites Himself to a created reality in a single, structured act. This union:

- Preserves the full integrity of both the divine and the created
- Forms one unified thing
- Reflects the pattern revealed in the hypostatic union of Christ
- Exists through the agency of the Holy Spirit
- Is made possible because of Christ’s person and work

---

# AXIOM: Christ's Hypostatic Union as Foundation

- Christ’s hypostatic union is the origin and ontological foundation of all bridge doctrines.
- It is the only instance of a union between divine and human **natures** in one **person**.
- All other bridge doctrines are **dependent unions**. They are not person-unions, but structured participations in Christ’s union.
- These unions are applied to creation through the Holy Spirit.

# STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS OF A BRIDGE DOCTRINE

To qualify as a bridge doctrine, a doctrine must:

1. Involve a fully divine element
2. Involve a fully created element
3. Join these elements into one unified act or reality
4. Preserve the distinction of each nature without separation or confusion
5. Exist through Christ and be applied through the Spirit

# CATEGORY: Not Bridge Doctrines

These doctrines do **not** meet the requirements listed above.

## Divine-Only Doctrines

- Examples: Divine simplicity, omniscience, eternality
- Description: Describe God as He is in Himself
- Reason excluded: No created element is involved or joined

## Created-Only Doctrines

- Examples: Angelology, natural law, human reason
- Description: Describe created things that relate to God
- Reason excluded: No union with divine substance or agency

## Doctrines of Interaction, Not Union

- Examples: Miracles, divine wrath, divine guidance
- Description: God acts in creation without uniting to it
- Reason excluded: No lasting structure of divine-creation unity is formed

---

# CATEGORY: Related but Distinct

## The Trinity

- The Trinity reflects similar grammar: distinction without division, unity without confusion
- It is not a bridge doctrine
- Reason: It describes the inner life of God, not a union between the divine and the created

---

# WHY THIS MATTERS

- The Unified Distinction Pattern applies only to bridge doctrines
- Misapplying the pattern leads to theological confusion or category errors
- Correctly identifying bridge doctrines protects the integrity of both divine and created elements
- These doctrines are where heaven and earth meet through Christ

---

# SUMMARY: Core Logic

- Only Christ unites divine and created natures in one person
- All other bridge doctrines are dependent unions
- These are real, structured, Spirit-applied participations in the hypostatic union
- They follow Chalcedonian grammar: full divinity, full createdness, real union, maintained distinction
